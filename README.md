## flashprint-rs

An implementation of FlashPrint's Wi-Fi printing in Rust.

This project supports all the commands to actually print files from code, not neccessarily all the commands the printer supports.

Printer used: FlashForge Adventurer 5M Pro

This was created based on capturing Flashprint's packets using WireShark.
